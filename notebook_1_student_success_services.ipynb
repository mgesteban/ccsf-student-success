    "The cleaned headcount data reveals significant enrollment volatility at City College of San Francisco over the 11-year study period (2014-2025), with no missing values across all academic years. Starting at 70,197 students in 2014-2015, enrollment remained relatively stable through 2019-2020 (averaging ~66,000 students), but then experienced a catastrophic 37% decline during the 2020-2021 academic year due to COVID-19, plummeting to just 38,798 students—the lowest point in the entire dataset. While enrollment has been recovering steadily since then with year-over-year increases of 4.5%, 11.4%, and 5.2%, the 2024-2025 enrollment of 46,308 students remains 34% below the 2014-2015 peak, indicating that CCSF has not yet returned to pre-pandemic enrollment levels. This dramatic enrollment shift will be critical context for analyzing service participation rates and program completion trends, as raw service counts must be normalized by student headcount to accurately assess institutional performance over time."

    "While Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) data was collected and clean for this study, I ultimately excluded it from the final analysis because of methodological mismatch with my research question. FTES is a unit-load metric(where 15 units = 1.0 FTES) designed primarily for state funding calculations, measuring the aggregate instructional burden rather than individual student outcomes; in contrast, this study examines whether student support service participation increases the likelihood that individual students will complete programs or certificates, which is inherently a person-based outcome rather than a unit-based measure. Using FTES as a normalization metric would conflate two different units of analysis—instructional load versus individual student success—creating an \"apples to oranges\" comparison that obscures rather than illuminates the relationship between service utilization and program completion.  Student headcount provides the methodologically appropriate denominator for this research because both the independent variables (service participation counts) and dependent variable (program completions) are person-based metrics: students either do or do not receive services, and students either do or do not complete programs, making headcount-normalized rates (per 1,000 students) the correct approach for examining this research question.

    "Program awards data were cleaned by extracting the San Francisco Total row from each of four DataMart CSV files covering academic years 2014–2015 through 2024–2025. For each file, the function iterates through the annual award columns, converts award counts from string format to integers (handling commas, floats, and missing values), and constructs a clean dataset containing one row per academic year. This process produced four standardized time-series tables, each representing a distinct award category, and confirmed consistent year-to-year trends with notable increases during the COVID-19 period (2020–2022). The resulting datasets provide a reliable foundation for longitudinal analysis and correlation with student support service participation."

    "Data Quality and Completion Rate Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The program awards data demonstrate strong overall data quality. All 11 academic years from 2014–2015 through 2024–2025 are present, and there are no missing values in either the academic year or total awards fields, indicating that the data extraction and cleaning process was successful. Descriptive statistics show an average of approximately 4,854 awards per year, with expected year-to-year variation and a clear upward trend following the COVID-19 period.\n",
    "\n",
    "What initially appears anomalous is the high average completion rate of 99.8 awards per 1,000 students, which increases dramatically during and after the pandemic years. After verifying the figures directly against the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office DataMart Program Awards reports, the counts were confirmed to be accurate and correctly downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factors likely explain this elevated completion rate. First, the DataMart “Program Awards” category encompasses more than traditional AA/AS degrees. It includes a broad range of awards such as noncredit certificates, short-term and skills certificates, and Chancellor’s Office–approved certificates. Examination of the underlying files shows a substantial volume of noncredit and short-term awards, which can significantly inflate total completions relative to headcount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, COVID-19 had a pronounced denominator effect. In 2020–2021, enrollment declined sharply to approximately 38,800 students, while awards increased to 5,617. This resulted in a spike in the completion rate from 75.5 to 144.8 awards per 1,000 students. Pandemic-related policy changes, accelerated credential pathways, emergency workforce certificates, and increased flexibility in completion requirements likely contributed to this surge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while City College of San Francisco may outperform peer institutions in certain completion outcomes, rates of this magnitude exceed typical statewide and national community college benchmarks. This suggests the pattern is driven primarily by award definitions and enrollment dynamics rather than uniquely exceptional institutional performance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these findings indicate that the high completion rate is valid but must be interpreted cautiously. Subsequent analyses will distinguish between award types and consider alternative normalization strategies to ensure meaningful comparisons over time."
